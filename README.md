# NLP-Project
NLP PROJECT BY TEAM SNAP 2020 This is a team project by Suryansh Bhandari, Naman Mantri, Ankit Chapparia and Prakhar Sharma. This project was done under the guidnace of Dr.Shakti Balan Muthia. It was based on Natural Language Processing to do a few operations on two books of our choice. The books choosed were Adentures Of Sherlock Holmes by Artur Conan Doyle and Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. TEAM_SNAP_PROJECT.py contains the code for both the books. Images for different graphs, word clouds and csv files for POS_tagging are in the repository.

Round2 consists of preprocessing book and then find verb and noun categories and then find entities in the book and the relation between them.
